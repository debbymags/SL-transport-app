# SL-transport-app

Hi there!
I'm Deborah Magbadelo, a final year student of Computer Science at the University of Ibadan.
I built an android app (a minimum viable product) to provide transportation assistance for deaf and hard-of-hearing (DHH) individuals.

Yes, the app is built primarily for the DHH community.
But I would like to get feedback from both DHH and non-DHH persons.
Thank you for your input.

This project is carried out as a requirement to complete my Bachelors Degree under the supervision of Dr Aderonke Sakpere.

Here's a link to the app (SL-transport-app)

Please download the apk file and install it on your android device.
Please note: This app is for testing purposes. While installing the app, you'll need to enable the “Allow unknown sources” option when it pops up.

You can navigate the app and assess its features.
